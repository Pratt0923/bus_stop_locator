#### Important things to look at
* Thank you for using this application! If you are a developer and want to fork this code or maybe you just want to know some more about it, I am going to tell you a little bit about the important aspects of this project. This was a day project to explore enumerables at The Iron Yard.
* The lib/modules/locatable.rb - Something that is very important. This is the whole foundation of the project which was to learn how to use enumerables and modules.
* Map Controller - Some of the logic occurs here. This is where the coordinates for the address the user has entered are found and shown to the locatable.rb file.
